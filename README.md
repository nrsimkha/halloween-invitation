Website to invite people to a Halloween party by sharing a link.

#### Avaliable features: ####

* Guests vote to choose Halloween menu 
* Halloween mini-game (game type - "collect three gems in a row")
* Create playlist for Halloween party together (using Spotify API)
* Accept/decline invitation form
***
This web application was built using pure Javascript.

In this project I worked on:

* CSS animations on inline SVG elements
* simple 2D game using HTML Canvas and Javascript
* connecting web app to Spotify API to retrieve tracks by user's request
* using Firebase Realtime Database to store guest data and playlist data
